1. npm install -g @angular/cli //command to install angular 4

3. cd my-angular4-project
4. ng serve // builds the code and starts the web server at default 4200 port

properties of the component), a template file which is .html, a styling file which is .css or others, .ts.spec file for unit testing.
6. Module in Angular refers to a place where you can group the components, directives, pipes, and services, which are related to the application.
7. main.ts calls the bootstrap module which is 'AppModule'. Inside 'AppModule'(app.module.ts) it defines the bootstrap component to be used 'AppComponent'
which has 'app-root' as the selector.
